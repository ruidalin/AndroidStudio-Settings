      <item value="Constant to return from {@link onStartCommand}: if this service's process is killed while it is started (after returning from {@link onStartCommand}), then leave it in the started state but don't retain this delivered intent. Later the system will try to re-create the service. Because it is in the started state, it will guarantee to call {@link onStartCommand} after creating the new service instance; if there are not any pending start commands to be delivered to the service, it will be called with a null intent object, so you must take care to check for this. &lt;p&gt;This mode makes sense for things that will be explicitly started and stopped to run for arbitrary periods of time, such as a service performing background music playback." />
      <item value="Constant to return from {@link onStartCommand}: if this service's process is killed while it is started (after returning from {@link onStartCommand}), and there are no new start intents to deliver to it, then take the service out of the started state and don't recreate until a future explicit call to {@link ContextstartService Context.startService(Intent)}. The service will not receive a {@link onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)} call with a null Intent because it will not be restarted if there are no pending Intents to deliver. &lt;p&gt;This mode makes sense for things that want to do some work as a result of being started, but can be stopped when under memory pressure and will explicit start themselves again later to do more work. An example of such a service would be one that polls for data from a server: it could schedule an alarm to poll every N minutes by having the alarm start its service. When its {@link onStartCommand} is called from the alarm, it schedules a new alarm for N minutes later, and spawns a thread to do its networking. If its process is killed while doing that check, the service will not be restarted until the alarm goes off." />
